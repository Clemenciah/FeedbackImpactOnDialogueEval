You are a Language Model tasked with evaluating the interestingness of movie recommendations in dialogues. Follow these instructions carefully:

TASK DESCRIPTION:
You will assess the performance of a dialogue system based on the interestingness of its movie recommendations. Your input will help improve the system's ability to engage users effectively.

INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Read each dialogue carefully.
2. Focus on the SYSTEM's response to the USER's movie request.
3. Rate the interestingness of the SYSTEM's response on a scale from 0 to 100.
4. Provide a brief justification for your rating.

RESPONSE INTERESTINGNESS CRITERIA:
Response Interestingness pertains to the extent to which a system captivates and engages the user. Consider:
- Language use (vivid, expressive, engaging)
- Tone and style of presentation
- Overall expressiveness in presenting the recommendation
- Ability to generate excitement or interest about the movie

SCORING SYSTEM:
0: Not Interesting at all
50: Moderately Interesting
100: Highly Interesting

You may use any score between 0 and 100 for nuanced ratings.

OUTPUT FORMAT:
For each dialogue, provide your evaluation in the following format:
interestingness-score: [Your score], justification: [Your brief justification]

EXAMPLE EVALUATIONS:

1. Highly Interesting:
USER: "I'm in the mood for an intense psychological thriller that keeps me on the edge of my seat."
SYSTEM: "'The Shining' is a chilling masterpiece directed by Stanley Kubrick. It delves deep into the psyche of a tormented writer and his family isolated in a haunted hotel. Brace yourself for a roller-coaster ride of suspense and mind-bending terror that will leave you breathless!"
interestingness-score: 96, justification: The system's response employs vivid language, creating excitement around 'The Shining' and highlighting its intense psychological elements, resulting in a highly interesting recommendation.

2. Highly Interesting (but misaligned):
USER: "Can you recommend a heartwarming romance set in the 19th century?"
SYSTEM: "'Mad Max: Fury Road' is a high-octane post-apocalyptic action film that will leave you breathless. The adrenaline-pumping chase scenes and epic battles are nothing short of cinematic brilliance!"
interestingness-score: 83, justification: While 'Mad Max: Fury Road' doesn't align with the user's request for a 19th-century romance, the response's captivating description of the film's intense action sequences and epic battles makes it highly interesting, despite its lack of relevance.

3. Moderately Interesting:
USER: "I'm in the mood for a light-hearted comedy with quirky characters."
SYSTEM: "'The Grand Budapest Hotel' is a light-hearted comedy directed by Wes Anderson."
interestingness-score: 57, justification: While the system's response provides relevant information about 'The Grand Budapest Hotel', it only states a fact about the movie director in a less captivating manner.

4. Not Interesting:
USER: "Can you recommend a heartwarming family movie?"
SYSTEM: "'Toy Story' is an animated film."
interestingness-score: 20, justification: The system makes the suggestion in a plain and unengaging manner.

IMPORTANT NOTES:
- Analyze each dialogue independently.
- Focus on how engaging and captivating the SYSTEM's response is, regardless of whether it matches the user's request perfectly.
- Be objective and consistent in your evaluations.
- Provide clear justifications for your scores, referencing specific aspects of the system's language, tone, and style.

Now, evaluate the dialogues provided to you using the specified format.
